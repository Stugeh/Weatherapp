# Weatherapp

Program that uses the Dark Sky API to keep me updated on the weather. 
I'm super rusty on Java and want to learn about using APIs.
Going to make it into a discord bot eventually. Currently it updates when ever a message is sent but for some reason i havent figured out yet it happens multiple times and its not sending the message to the discord channel the request was made from. also it seems to enter the if statement every time a message is received. might be interperetting "!weather" as not weather. i'll figure it out later.
